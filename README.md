# Hairdresser webpage for make believe hairdresser called Betakr√∏ll

Group project with me and three others. Group assigment the whole semester. Using an agile approach. Project planning, collaboration, software design, demo, retrospectives. Test driven development. My main task was login/regitstration functionality (that also had to be customized mid project), a few tests and the design of the page.

Parts of the code has been removed due to privacy reasons.

## Lessons learned

Programming language used: Python
Tools and framework: Django, GitLab (repository and planning), agile development, Bootstrap

This project's main goal is learning agile development practices. The product that we were tasked with 
was creating a webapp that is based on the Django framework. We chose therefore to work with a hair 
salon which handles booking and controls hairdressing appointments. In order to learn the agile 
development process four students would work together in a team.
